# RSA-Encryption-Demonstration
Simple Program Demonstrating RSA Encryption

The RSA Encryption algorithm is an asymmetric cryptography algorithm, meaning that it works using two different keys. These keys are the private key and public key. The public key is known by everyone and the private key is kept private. The first part of the public key is generated by selecting two prime numbers which are multiplied together, say
(p x q) = n. We will need an exponent, say e. "e" must be an integer and a non-factor of n. The private key is generated in two parts, first by calculating Φ(n) = (p - 1)(q - 1), we then calculate private key d, d = (k x Φ(n) + 1) / e for integer k. You now have your public keys and private keys.

This program requests two prime numbers from the user which are checked for valid input, the user is then asked to input the message they would like to encrypt (this message can be up to 128 characters). After inputting the user selected message the possible values of the coprime to totient(n), e which is the public key exponent used for the encryption. The message is then encrypted and displayed in the console. The message is then decrypted and displayed in the console.
